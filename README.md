# Fashion House

This project involved the revival of my Mother's cherished fashion house website. Initially built in Flash, the site had become outdated. My task was to transition the existing content into the modern web, ensuring its legacy continues to shine.

Although a majority of the high-resolution images were irretrievably lost, I managed to retain and migrate the rest of the content. The site now stands as a testament to her fashion legacy, accessible and ready for the modern user.
